This report describes our group's implementation of a computer vision algorithm to detect Waldo, Wenda, and the Wizard from a series of "Where's Waldo" books. The goal of this project is to detect the three characters from the provided high-resolution images, which can be very complex with a lot of detail and many other characters. The three characters also may or may not appear in any given image.
